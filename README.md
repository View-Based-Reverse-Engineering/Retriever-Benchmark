# Benchmark Retriever
[![Running Retriever](https://github.com/PalladioSimulator/Palladio-ReverseEngineering-Benchmark/actions/workflows/reverse_engineering.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PalladioSimulator/Palladio-ReverseEngineering-Benchmark/actions/workflows/reverse_engineering.yml) [![Pages Build](https://github.com/PalladioSimulator/Palladio-ReverseEngineering-Benchmark/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PalladioSimulator/Palladio-ReverseEngineering-Benchmark/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment)

This repository presents a benchmark for the view-based [Retriever approach](https://github.com/PalladioSimulator/Palladio-ReverseEngineering-Retriever) to reverse engineering software architecture models. This approach enables the reverse engineering of software architecture models from heterogeneous artifacts by extracting structural and behavioral views from existing software artifacts using rule-based processes. The views are then refined to ensure completeness and consistency, and model-driven composition connects the different views. These views provide a comprehensive understanding of software systems and support model-driven analysis and quality prediction.

## Project Structures
Each benchmark project is structured as follows:
* The `.ruleengine.yml` file contains the configuration for running the retriever approach.
  * The `repository` value is the ID of a GitHub repository.
  * The `current_version` value is the latest version of the [Retriever approach](https://github.com/PalladioSimulator/Palladio-ReverseEngineering-Retriever/releases) used to build the architectural models.
  * The `rules` values are the rules used to build the architectural models.
* The `model_re` folder contains the architectural model of the system that is automatically generated by the Retriever approach.
  * The `pcm` folder contains the [Palladio Component Model (PCM)](https://sdq.kastel.kit.edu/wiki/Palladio_Component_Model) of the system.
  * The `uml` folder contains the [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com) model.
* The `model_gs` folder contains our manual gold standards for the system.

## Using the Benchmark
The easiest way to use our approach is to use the CLI that we have [released](https://github.com/PalladioSimulator/Palladio-ReverseEngineering-Retriever/releases). Hereâ€™s an example of how to call the [CLI](https://github.com/PalladioSimulator/Palladio-ReverseEngineering-SoMoX-RuleEngine/blob/master/bundles/org.palladiosimulator.somox.analyzer.rules.main/src/org/palladiosimulator/somox/analyzer/rules/cli/RuleEngineApplication.java) application with the given parameters:

> ./eclipse -i /path/to/input/directory -o /path/to/output/directory -r supported_rules

Here, replace `/path/to/input/directory` with the path to the root directory of the project you want to reverse engineer, `/path/to/output/directory` with the path to the output directory where you want to store the generated models, and `supported_rules` with the [rules](https://github.com/PalladioSimulator/Palladio-ReverseEngineering-SoMoX-RuleEngine/tree/master/bundles/org.palladiosimulator.somox.analyzer.rules.impl/src/org/palladiosimulator/somox/analyzer/rules/impl) you want to use for reverse engineering.
